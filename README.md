# Rights Con 2025 Presentation Material

Session:
## Decolonizing shutdown circumvention: strategy and skill for circumvention training in shutdown areas

In the current digital rights field, efforts related to digital safety for human rights often focus on privacy, anti-censorship, and anti-surveillance. However, there is limited emphasis on internet shutdown circumvention. Most existing research and work on internet shutdowns have been directed toward advocacy and litigation. While the long-term fight remains crucial, strategies for circumvention, tool recommendations, and digital safety measures during internet shutdowns have yet to be fully explored and promoted. This gap leaves people silenced before advocacy efforts can fully succeed.  

Therefore, this session will focus on providing hands-on training in circumvention tactics for on-the-ground users. Technologists and trainers from more developed countries often use a top-down approach, overlooking local needs, threat models, and specific political and economic context. For example, circumvention materials often suggest using VPNs, but they do not address the issue that citizens in developing countries may not own smartphones or that VPNs do not work during full blackouts.  

This workshop will start with an experience-sharing session on organizing trainings and Training of Trainers (TOT) in less developed countries. We will focus on the importance of a bottom-up and collaborative approach, as well as special skills for training people in shutdown circumvention, such as how to explain the technical concepts effectively. This will be followed by multiple rounds of discussion with participants on different aspects, such as essential skills, considerations, and resources for planning and conducting effective training sessions.
